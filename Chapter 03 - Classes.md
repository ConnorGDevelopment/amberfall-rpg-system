# Classes

Each **Character** in the Amberfall System has a Class that details the **Martial**, **Arcane**, **Psionic**, and **Divine** powers they possess and can attain.

## Advancement

Each **Class** has an Advancement Path, which represents the potential growth that can be made in each of the six **Stats**. Advancements are 5% increases in a **Stat** and are awarded by your DM as you defeat powerful foes, perform great feats of skill, or progress the story of your campaign. When spending Advancements, you must raise each **Stat** by half of the value shown in your Advancement Path before raising them any further.

## Capstone Powers

Each **Class** also has a variety of abilities known as Capstone Powers. The Capstone Powers available to you are based on the number of Advancements you have in that **Class**.

## Hit Points

Every **Entity** has a number of Hit Points (HP) that represents the amount of damage they can take before collapsing. To calculate your Maximum HP use the following formula:

    (First Digit of Fortitude Score + Class Hit Point Bonus) * Level
