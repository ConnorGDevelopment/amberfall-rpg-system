# Critical Results

In the Amberfall System, it is intended that Stat and Skill Checks can have Critical Results. That means when you roll a 1, something spectacular occurs, and if you roll a 100, something devastating occurs. However, like any rule written in this book, the decision to implement it is up to you as the DM.

In most roleplaying game systems, the concept of a Critical Result is usually reserved for actions related to combat. This is in part, because most actions in combat are deterministic. When you attack a goblin and hit, you always roll some dice to deal damage. And importantly, when the DM asks 'PNTWIWYMTLA' and you say 'I lunge at them with my grandpa's sword and stab them right through the chest', that narration only adds flavor and style to the outcome.

> PNTWIWYMTLA is an acronym for 'Please narrate the way in which you make this lethal attack', an iconic and well known phrase in roleplaying game culture.

The reason most systems state that Critical Results don't apply to non-combat checks is because there are no rules written for how you should specifically narrate something. When you roll a Critical Failure trying to ask your crush on a date, you *generally* don't go roll on the 'Rejection Table' to find out what they say back to you.

> If your character gets rejected so often that your DM has made a table for that... sorry pal.

But Critical Results are fun and exciting. If you've played a roleplaying game before, you know that many DM's make Critical Results feel special, regardless of what the rules say.

> For Players, rolling a 1 on a d100 is significantly rarer than rolling a 20 on a d20, so it should be celebrated a lot more. However, rolling a 1 does not give anyone but the DM the ability to warp reality. A Critical Success on Persuasion doesn't mean an evil Lich automatically becomes your best friend and you swiftly destroy the plot of your campaign. That being said, your DM can make a miracle happen, many ancient evils lack meaningful companionship and a solid support network.
> For DM's, rolling a 100 on a d100 is also significantly rarer than rolling a 1 on a d20. It should be devastating but not unfun. A Critical Failure on Stealth while trying to sneak through a Dragon's castle shouldn't immediately end with the Dragon showing up and killing the whole party, because that sucks. It should at a minimum though, end with the party running for their lives through the castle while you shout 'Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins' at them.
