## Erodomancy

Erodomancy is often underestimated as a school of magic. While Erodomantic spells lack the flashiness and volatility of Pyromantic or Fulguromantic spell, they boast the greatest destructive capabilities. Erodomancers typically bombard enemies and structures until they become saturated with acid, at which point even minor cantrips can be absolutely devastating.

### Cantrips

#### Spittle

You spit a stream of acid onto an **Entity** within 60 feet. The target must make a **Dexterity** **Save** or take 1d6 **Acid** damage. If the target is wearing **Armor**, their **Armor Bonus** is reduced by 1 until the end of your next turn.
