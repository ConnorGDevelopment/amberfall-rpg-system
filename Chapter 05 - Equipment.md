## Carrying Capacity

A character's Carrying Capacity is the amount of weight they can carry on their person without adversely hindering their movement, assuming the items being carried do not themselves hinder a character's movement.

> Carrying Capacity is intended to be non-exploitable and it does not represent the ability to *do* anything, it is a measure of how much weight you can comfortably walk around with.
> If you are trying to *do* something and you begin your sentence with "I have a carrying capacity of..." then you're already off to a bad start.

    Carrying Capacity = Strength Score * 4

### Encumberance

Characters are capable of carrying an amount of weight that exceeds their Carrying Capacity but they receive the Encumbered condition, the effects of each Encumberance Level are detailed below.

| Level | Weight Threshold | Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Between 4 and 5 times Strength Score | Movement Speed is reduced by 25% and Physical Skill Checks receive a -10% penalty |
| 2 | Between 5 and 6 times Strength Score | Movement Speed is reduced by 50% and Physical Skill Checks receive a -25% penalty |
| 3 | Between 6 and 7 times Strength Score | Movement Speed is reduced by 75% and Physical Skill Checks receive a -50% penalty |
| 4 | Between 7 and 8 times Strength Score | Movement Speed is set to 5 feet and Physical Skill Checks receive a -75% |
| 5 | More than 8 times Strength Score | Character is Immobilized and Physical Skill Checks are automatically failed |

### Overhead Lift Capacity

The amount of weight a character can readily lift above their head.

> Overhead Lift Capacity almost explicitly represents the amount of weight your character could shoulder press without expending much effort.
> It is your 'put a box on a high shelf' capacity, not your 'stopping a boulder from crushing your' capacity.

    Overhead Lift Capacity = Strength Score * 2

### Deadlift Capacity

The amount of weight a character can readily pick up from their feet and raise to waist height.

> Deadlift Capacity does not imply the ability to walk around freely with the object you have picked up.
> Your ability to walk around with a heavy object is determined by your Carrying Capacity, because you're doing something roughly equivalent to waddling around with a barbell.

    Deadlift Capacity = Strength Score * 10

### Push and Pull Strength

The amount of force a character could easily exert when pushing or pulling an object.

> Push and Pull Strength is specifically the 'force' a character can exert, not an amount of weight.
> This distinction is important because objects like pulleys can allow a character to push or pull an object well beyond their normal limits.

    Push and Pull Strength = Strength Score * 4
