# Skills

Skills are narrow applications of an **Entity's** **Stats** and are broken into two categories, Basic and Advanced. An **Entity** may receive training or experience in a Skill from a variety of sources, which is referred to as **Proficiency**.

Basic Skills can be attempted by anyone regardless of their **Proficiency**, while Advanced Skills can only be attempted by an **Entity** with **Proficiency** in that Skill.

## Checks

When an **Entity** attempts an action that has a chance of failure, they must make a Check to determine the outcome.

There are two kinds of Checks, Stat and Skill. Stat Checks are used for general actions where practice or training wouldn't meaningfully influence the outcome more than an **Entity's** raw ability in that **Stat**.

> An Olympic Weightlifter's training doesn't really impact their ability to open pickle jars more than their actual strength.

Skill Checks are used for when practice or training would meaningfully influence the outcome and/or the task would be challenging or even impossible for someone without experience.

> A Lifeguard's training in CPR significantly impacts their ability to resuscitate an unconscious person more than their lung capacity.

To resolve a Stat Check, roll a d100. If you rolled a number equal to or less than your score in the **Stat** then you succeed. If you rolled a number greater than your score in the **Stat** then you fail.

Skill Checks are resolved the same way as Stat Checks except if you don't have **Proficiency** in that **Skill** then you only succeed if you roll a number equal to or lower than half your score in the associated **Stat**, rounded down.

### Degrees of Success and Failure

Not all **Checks** are simple pass or fail tests, in these cases the result is determined using Degrees of Success and/or Degrees of Failure. You receive one Degree of Success for every 10% you succeed a **Check** by and one Degree of Failure for every 10% you fail a **Check** by.

## Group Checks

When multiple **Entities** in a group make the same **Check**, it may be treated as a Group Check. In a Group Check, the entire group gets the same result based on how well the majority of the party performs. If the majority succeeds, everyone succeeds. If the majority fails, everyone fails.
