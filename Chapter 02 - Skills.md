# Skills

Skills are narrow applications of an **Entity's** **Stats** and are broken into two categories, Basic and Advanced. An **Entity** may receive training or experience in a Skill from a variety of sources, which is referred to as **Proficiency**.

Basic Skills can be attempted by anyone regardless of their **Proficiency**, while Advanced Skills can only be attempted by an **Entity** with **Proficiency** in that Skill.

## Checks

When an **Entity** attempts an action that has a chance of failure, they must make a Check to determine the outcome.

There are two kinds of Checks, Stat and Skill. Stat Checks are used for general actions where practice or training wouldn't meaningfully influence the outcome more than an **Entity's** raw ability in that **Stat**.

> An Olympic Weightlifter's training doesn't really impact their ability to open pickle jars more than their actual strength.

Skill Checks are used for when practice or training would meaningfully influence the outcome and/or the task would be challenging or even impossible for someone without experience.

> A Lifeguard's training in CPR significantly impacts their ability to resuscitate an unconscious person more than their lung capacity.

To resolve a Stat Check, roll a d100. If you rolled a number equal to or less than your score in the **Stat** then you succeed. If you rolled a number greater than your score in the **Stat** then you fail.

Skill Checks are resolved the same way as Stat Checks except if you don't have **Proficiency** in that **Skill** then you only succeed if you roll a number equal to or lower than half your score in the associated **Stat**, rounded down.

### Degrees of Success and Failure (DoS / DoF)

Not all **Checks** are simple pass or fail tests, in these cases the result is determined using Degrees of Success and/or Degrees of Failure. You receive one Degree of Success for passing a **Check** and an additional Degree of Success for every 10% you succeed a **Check** by. Inversely, you receive one Degree of Failure for failing a **Check** and an additional Degree of Failure for every 10% you fail a **Check** by.

## Challenge Modifiers (CM)

An Entity's ability to make **Check** may be enhanced or inhibited by outside forces. In these situations, a percentage known as a Challenge Modifier is added or subtracted from their roll before they determine if they succeeded or failed that **Check**.

## Contested Checks

When an Entity does something that another Entity has a chance to avoid or resist, a Contested Check is made. In a Contested Check, the Defending Entity makes a **Check** with the Opposing Entity's Challenge Modifier. 

To calculate the **Challenge Modifier** applied by an **Entity's** **Stat** or **Skill**, use the following formula:

> Stat/Skill % - 50% = Challenge Modifier

## Group Checks

When multiple **Entities** in a group make the same **Check**, it may be treated as a Group Check. In a Group Check, the result for the entire group is determined by whether or not the majority of the group succeeded or failed their individual **Check**.

## Teamwork Checks

When multiple **Entities** in a group are contributing towards a shared goal, but using different **Skills**, it may be treated as a Teamwork Check. In a Teamwork Check, the result is determined by how many Degrees of Success or Failure are achieved collectively by the group.

### Simple vs Scaling

Simple Teamwork Checks have a single result that is either achieved or not achieved. The opposite of this is Scaling Teamwork Checks, where the result may change based on the amount of successes or failures.

### Additive vs Subtractive

In an Additive Teamwork Check, the result is only determined by the total degrees of success. Inversely, Subtractive Teamwork Checks determine their result by subtracting the total degrees of failure from the total degrees of success.
