# The Basics

## Terminology Used

- Character: A stat block controlled by a Player.
- Creature: A stat block controlled by the Dungeon Master.
- Entity: The union of Character and Creature.

## Stats
The Amberfall System uses six stats to describe Entities, these stats use a 0-100 scale with higher numbers being better.

### Strength (Str)
An Entity's physical might and power, used to determine how hard you hit and push things.

### Dexterity (Dex)
An Entity's physical grace and agility, used to determine how hard you are to hit and your general hand-eye coordination.

### Fortitude (For)
An Entity's brawn and resilience, used to determine how hard you are to kill, tranquilize, poison, etc.

> Why Fortitude instead of Constitution? So each stat has a unique letter.

### Intelligence (Int)
An Entity's ability to learn and recall information, used to determine how hard you can think.

### Wisdom (Wis)
An Entity's emotional resolve and empathy, used to determine how hard you are to manipulate and your capacity to understand and connect with other entities.

### Charisma (Cha)
An Entity's social ability and ego strength, used to determine how hard people laugh at your jokes and your ability to exert your personality on people.

## Stat Bonus
To calculate the 'Bonus' of a Stat, use either of the following methods:

1. Divide the Stat by 10 and round down.
2. Read the first digit of the Stat out loud. 

## Skills
Skills are narrow applications of an Entity's Stats and are broken in to two categories, Basic and Advanced. If an Entity has training or practice using a Skill, then they have Proficiency in that Skill. 

Basic Skills can be attempted by anyone regardless of their Proficiency, while Advanced Skills can only be attempted by an Entity with Proficiency in that Skill.

## Checks
When an Entity attempts an action that has a chance of failure, they must make a Check to determine the outcome. 

There are two kinds of Checks, Stat and Skill. Stat Checks are used for general actions where practice or training wouldn't meaningfully influence the outcome more than an Entity's raw ability in that Stat. 

> An Olympic Weightlifter's training doesn't really impact their ability to open pickle jars more than their actual strength.

Skill Checks are used for when practice or training would meaningfully influence the outcome and/or the task would be challenging or even impossible for someone without experience.

> A Lifeguard's training in CPR significantly impacts their ability to resuscitate an unconscious person more than their lung capacity.

To resolve a Stat Check, roll a d100. If you rolled a number equal to or less than your score in the Stat then you succeed. If you rolled a number greater than your score in the Stat than you fail.

Rolling a 1 is considered a Critical Success and things go almost miraculously well while rolling a 100 is considered a Critical Failure and things go as poorly as possible.

> Critical Successes and Critical Failures

> For Players, rolling a 1 on a d100 is significantly rarer than rolling a 20 on a d20, so it should be celebrated a lot more. However, rolling a 1 does not give anyone but the DM the ability to warp reality. A Critical Success on Persuasion doesn't mean an evil Lich automatically becomes your best friend and you swiftly destroy the plot of your campaign. That being said, your DM can make a miracle happen, many ancient evils lack meaningful companionship and a solid support network.

> For DM's, rolling a 100 on a d100 is also significantly rarer than rolling a 1 on a d20. It should be devastating but not unfun. A Critical Failure on Stealth while trying to sneak through a Dragon's castle shouldn't immediately end with the Dragon showing up and killing the whole party, because that sucks. It should at a minimum though, end with the party running for their lives through the castle while you shout 'Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins' at them.

Skill Checks are resolved the same way as Stat Checks except if you don't have Proficiency in that Skill then you only succeed if you roll a number equal to or lower than half your score in the associated Stat, rounded down.
