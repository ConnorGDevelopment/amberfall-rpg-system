# The Basics

## Terminology Used

- Character: A stat block controlled by a Player.
- Creature: A stat block controlled by the Dungeon Master.
- Entity: The union of Character and Creature.

## Stats
The Amberfall System uses six stats to describe entities, these stats use a 0-100 scale with higher numbers being better.

### Strength (Str)
An entity's physical might and power, used to determine how hard you hit and push things.

### Dexterity (Dex)
An entity's physical grace and agility, used to determine how hard you are to hit and your general hand-eye coordination.

### Fortitude (For)
An entity's brawn and resilience, used to determine how hard you are to kill, tranquilize, poison, etc.

> Why Fortitude instead of Constitution? So each stat has a unique letter.

### Intelligence (Int)
An entity's ability to learn and recall information, used to determine how hard you can think.

### Wisdom (Wis)
An entity's emotional resolve and empathy, used to determine how hard you are to manipulate and your capacity to understand and connect with other entities.

### Charisma (Cha)
An entity's social ability and ego strength, used to determine how hard people laugh at your jokes and your ability to exert your personality on people.

## Stat Bonus
To calculate the 'Bonus' of a Stat, use either of the following methods:

1. Divide the Stat by 10 and round down.
2. Read the first digit of the Stat out loud.
