## Starting Stats

The final step of making a **Character** is determining your starting **Stats**. To do so, ask your DM what **Campaign Difficulty** you will be using and find the corresponding table below. Each table lists a Point Pool Size at the top, which is the currency you spend to buy **Stat** scores, and the cost of each **Stat** score. You'll need to buy a score for each of the six **Stats** and you are not required or may be unable to spend all of your points. If your DM is using the **Boon** system, detailed below, you'll be able to use unspent points on purchasing **Boons**.
