## Starting Stats

The final step of making a **Character** is determining your starting **Stats**. Each **Stat** has a baseline value it starts at and then you have a pool of points to distribute across those **Stats**, up to a maximum starting value. Below is a table of campaign difficulties and the associated baseline value, point pool size, and maximum starting value. If you're unsure of what campaign difficulty to use, ask your DM, as they will have selected one for you to use.

| Difficulty | Baseline Value | Maximum Starting Value | Point Pool Size |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Standard   | 25             | 50                     | 90              |
| Gritty     | 20             | 55                     | 90              |
